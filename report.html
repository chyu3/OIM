        Introduction: I have chosen to do a website article about figure skating. It it meant for a wide range of audience, 
        including skaters and those who are or might be interested in figure skating. The structure of my website is intended for a simple and refreshing look, 
        hence the structure is mainly built by using grids.

        Inspiration: Out of the many inspirations for this article, Yuzuru Hanyu (A male competitive figure skater) 
        would be the main motivation for this idea. He has shared his energy through his performances which has gained 
        him a lot of support as well as winning in Olympics. Other inspirations such as a female skater Alexandra Trusova, 
        she was once interviwed during her training which is close to the championships and within her speaking, I've spotted a 
        sentence which I think would bring courage and meaning to female figure skaters.
