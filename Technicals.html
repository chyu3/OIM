                                When attempting a toe loop, the figure skater jumps in a counter-clockwise motion. He (or she) quickly glides backwards over the ice rink before using the outside edge of their back skate — and the toe-pick of their front skate — to launch into the air. The performer spins half a revolution in mid-air before landing, once more, onto the outside edge of their back skate.

                                The lutz jump is exactly like the flip; only here the skater launches into the jump from the outside edge of their back foot rather than the inside edge. It’s very difficult to stay balanced when launching into a full, mid-air revolution from the outside edge of the skate. As a result, the lutz is a tricky move to master, requiring hours of hard work, pain and frustration. In the end, it’ll be worth all the effort though!

                                The axel is a key ice skating technique for all beginner skaters to aspire to! Here, the performer gathers momentum before launching forwards into the air by springing from the outside edge of their strongest foot. The skater spins one-and-a-half revolutions in mid-air before landing onto the outside edge of their weaker foot. Tricky, eh? Without the aid of a toe-pick to help launch the skater, this is an incredibly difficult maneuver which can take years of hard work to master.

                                This spin is self-explanatory really! It’s carried out when the performer skates on one leg only, whilst stretching the other limb straight out in front of them. Whilst spinning, the performer bends their skating leg as far as they can — essentially sitting down as low as possible without toppling over. In competition, judges award points based on how close to the ice a performer can bend whilst still maintaining their rhythm. It really is a case of ‘how low can you go?’

                                This popular move sees the performer position his or her body into a ‘T’ shape. The performer’s stronger leg is used for skating, whilst the other limb is stretched backwards, straight behind the skater’s head. During this spin, the performer leans their neck forward, bringing their head in line with the straightened rear leg. This maneuver may sound rather daunting, nevertheless, with practice and patience, the balance and suppleness that the camel spin requires will come to you in time.
